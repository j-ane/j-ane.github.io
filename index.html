    	<h2>hey there, my name is <b>jane zeng.</b>
        <br>I take a design-thinking approach to everyday data science.</h2>

    	<p>what do I mean by <b>design-thinking</b> in the context of data science?
        I believe a data scientist needs to balance being both data-driven and human-centered in order to creatively answer business problems. 
        data science is all about diving into ambiguity, but developing a deep understanding of who we're designing for can shed light in the correct direction. 
        I've come to learn that data science is more than just building models, it's about building models that are designed to be <b>insightful</b> and <b>useful</b> for the end user (whoever it may be).
    	</p>

      <p>
        now that you know all about my data science mindset, let me introduce myself. I recently graduated from <b>Duke</b> with a Master's in Business Analytics and did my undergrad at <b>UT Austin</b>. Before that,
        I worked as a Marketing Data Analyst at <b>Saatva</b> where I was 1/3 of the small but mighty analytics team. 
        during my gap year, I volunteered as a <b>digital marketing consultant</b> for some local businesses during my solo backpacking travels around Asia. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I am all about telling cool stories and driving decisions with data. my data-driven storytelling skills got me all the way to the finals of last year's Adobe Analytics Challenge (despite it being my first
        time even using Adobe Analytics). I recently completed a project for <b>Moog Music</b> where I transformed raw sales data into a book of customer stories based on their behavior. 
        it is so cool getting to predict the future with machine learning. what makes it even cooler is getting to <b>design that future</b> with data-driven stories.         
      </p>

      <p>
        outside of data science, I'm a radio dj playing songs from all around the world, an amateur home cook specializing in asian curries,  
        an owner of too many second-hand men's clothes, and a roommate to two border collies who don't pay rent.
