    	<h2>hey there, my name is <b>jane zeng.</b>
        <br>I take a design-thinking approach to everyday data science.</h2>

    	<p>what do I mean by a <b>design-thinking</b> in data science? during my studies I noticed parallels in design-thinking and data science approaches 
        to problems and how the former has the opportunity to fix some gaps in the latter.
        I believe a data scientist needs to balance being both data-driven and human-centered in order to creatively approach and correctly answer business problems. 
        data science is all about diving into ambiguity, but developing a deep understanding of who we're designing for can shed light in the correct direction. 
        I've come to learn that data science is more than just building models, it's about building models that are designed to be <b>insightful</b> and <b>useful</b> for the end user (whoever it may be).

        now that you know all about my data science mindset, let me introduce myself. I recently graduated from <b>Duke University</b> with a Master's degree in Business Analytics. Before that,
        I worked as a Marketing Data Analyst at <b>Saatva</b> where I was 1/3 of the small but mighty analytics team. I also earned my Bachelor's in Business from <b>The University of Texas at Austin</b> (hook 'em). 
        during my gap year, I volunteered as a <b>digital marketing consultant</b> for some local businesses during my solo backpacking travels around Asia. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I am all about telling cool stories and driving decisions with data. my data-driven storytelling skills got me all the way to the finals of last year's Adobe Analytics Challenge (despite it being my first
        time even using Adobe Analytics). I recently completed a project for <b>Moog Music</b> where I transformed raw sales data into a book of customer stories based on their behavior. 
        my secret to success, though it's not much a secret now that I'm putting this on the Internet, is to design these stories with <b>empathy</b> and <b>intent</b> before getting lost in the data. I've done
        more projects having to do with customer acquisition/retention (classification), user segmentation (clustering), survey results (conjoint analysis), and text (sentiment analysis).  
        It is so cool getting to predict the future with machine learning, even if it's just a simple linear regression. what makes it even cooler is getting to <b>design that future</b> with stories.         
      </p>

      <p>
        outside of data science, I'm a radio DJ where I showcase new underground music and world genres each week, an amateur home cook specializing in asian curries,  
        an owner of too many second-hand men's clothes, and a roommate to two border collies who don't pay rent.
