    	<h2>hey there, my name is <b>jane zeng.</b>
        <br>I take a design-thinking approach to everyday data science.</h2>

    	<p>What do I mean by <b>design-thinking</b> in the context of data science?
        As a data scientist, I balance being data-driven and human-centered to creatively answer business problems. 
        Data science is all about diving into ambiguity, but understanding who I'm designing for sheds light in the right direction. 
        To me, it's about building models that are designed to be <b>insightful</b> and <b>useful</b> to the end user.
    	</p>

      <p>
        Recently, I graduated from <b>Duke</b> with a Master in Business Analytics. 
        Before that, I did my undergrad at <b>UT Austin</b> and worked as a Marketing Data Analyst at <b>Saatva</b> where I was 1/3 of our mighty analytics team. 
        During my gap year, I volunteered as a <b>marketing consultant</b> for some local businesses during my solo backpacking travels around Asia. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I tell cool stories and drive decisions with data. My storytelling skills got me all the way to the finals of last year's <b>Adobe Analytics Challenge</b>. 
        I also completed a project for <b>Moog Music</b> where I transformed sales data into a book of customer stories based on behavior. 
        Predicting the future with machine learning is cool as is, but what makes it even cooler is getting to <b>design the future</b> with data-driven stories.         
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of data science, I'm a radio dj playing songs from all around the world, a home cook specializing in asian curries,  
        a collector of too many second-hand clothes, and a roommate to two border collies who don't pay rent.
